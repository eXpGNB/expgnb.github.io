# Roadmap
This roadmap provides a step-by-step guide to setting up a 5G core network and establishing a connection between the base station (gNodeB) and user equipment (UE), using OpenAirInterface (OAI) as the foundational software stack.

Throughout this process, students will gain hands-on experience with real-world 5G components and develop a strong understanding of:

The architecture of a 5G core network

The role and configuration of the gNodeB

The integration of physical hardware (e.g., USRP) with open-source software

End-to-end communication between the UE and the core network

As the stages progress, students will build a working 5G testbed and develop the technical depth needed to implement, configure, and troubleshoot 5G networks using OpenAirInterface.
